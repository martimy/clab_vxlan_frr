# VxLAN Labs

This repository includes multiple lab setups that illustrate several VxLAN deployment scenarios:

- VxLAN over point-to-point connection
- VxLAN over a ring topology using several VTEP discovery methods
- VxLAN over a start topology with multicast
- VxLAN over hub-and-spoke using BGP-EVPN
- VxLAN over a spine-leaf topology using BGP-EVPN


Note: These labs have been created using the following:

- Containerlab version: 0.54.2
- Docker version: 26.1.1
- FRRouting Docker image: quay.io/frrouting/frr:9.1.0 (FRR version: 9.1.0 running on Alpine Linux with Linux kernel 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)
- Linux image (for hosts): wbitt/network-multitool:alpine-minimal or wbitt/network-multitool:alpine-extra

## VxLAN

Virtual eXtensible Local-Area Network (VxLAN) is a standard network virtualization technology defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in [RFCâ€¯7348](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348). VXLANs encapsulates Ethernet frames within UDP packets and transport them over IP networks, making the underlying network transport between the VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP) devices.

VTEPs are responsible for encapsulating and encapsulating Ethernet frames into VXLAN packets. When two hosts exchange Ethernet frames within the same VXLAN segment but on a different physical network, the packet is encapsulated with a VXLAN header by the source VTEP. This header includes information such as the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) and the destination VTEP's IP address. When a VXLAN packet arrives at the destination VTEP, it is decapsulated to retrieve the original Ethernet frame, which is then forwarded to the destination VM.

Similar to VLANs, each VXLAN network identifier (VNI) uniquely identifies a Layer 2 subnet or segment, enabling communication between virtual machines within the same VNI without requiring routing, while communication across different VNIs requires a router. Unlike VLANs, VXLANs expand the Layer 2 network address space significantly, from 4K to more than 16 million.


### VTEP Discovery

VxLAN is essentially a tunnelling scheme. However, unlike other tunnels, a VXLAN builds a 1 to N network, not just point to point. VXLAN does not provide a control plane, and VTEP discovery and address learning is performed either dynamically in a manner similar to a learning bridge, or using statically-configured forwarding entries. The VTEP discovery [strategies](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-linux), include:

- BUM (broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast) flooding and address learning.
- Static L2/L3 entries
- Multicast
- EVPN


### FRRouting

This labs use FRRouting (FRR) to deploy VxLAN in several scenarios where each scenario implement one of the VTEP discovery strategy list above. FRR is an open source Internet routing protocol suite based on Linux. In all of the lab scenarios, the FRR is used as VTEP responsible for encapsulating/encapsulating the VxLAN packets from connected hosts. The FRR relies on Linux implementation of the Linux bridge and VxLAN interfaces as shown in the figure below:

FRR does not manage network interfaces directly. Instead it learns about the interface configuration from the Linux kernel. Therefore, the configuration of the bridge and the VxLAN interfaces shown in the figure must be handled by Linux.
