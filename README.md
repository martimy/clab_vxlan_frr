# VxLAN Labs

This repository includes multiple lab setups that illustrate multiple ways to deploy VxLANs:

- Point-to-Point VxLAN Tunnel
- Flooding over Underlay Network
- BGP-EVPN

## VxLAN

Virtual eXtensible Local-Area Network (VxLAN) is a standard network virtualization technology defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in [RFCâ€¯7348](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348). It carries Ethernet traffic over an existing IP network from, potentially, a large number of tenants while maintaining traffic separation.

VXLANs are encapsulated within UDP packets. The physical layout and geographic distance between nodes in the underlying network are irrelevant as long as UDP datagrams are forwarded between VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP) devices.

VXLANs expand the Layer 2 network address space significantly, from 4K to 16 million. Each VXLAN network identifier (VNI) uniquely identifies a Layer 2 subnet or segment, enabling communication between virtual machines within the same VNI without requiring routing, while communication across different VNIs requires a router.


VTEPs are responsible for encapsulating and decapsulating Ethernet frames into VXLAN packets. When a VM sends a packet to another VM within the same VXLAN segment but on a different host, the packet is encapsulated with a VXLAN header by the source VTEP. This header includes information such as the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) and the destination VTEP's IP address. When a VXLAN packet arrives at the destination VTEP, it is decapsulated to reveal the original Ethernet frame, which is then forwarded to the destination VM.


MAC learning in VxLAN is performed in two main ways. The data plane MAC learning is similar to the way Ethernet learns addresses using source address learning. Control plane learning uses MP-BGP to share MAC address and VTEP information.

These are the following learning [strategies](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-linux):

- Multicast
- Unicast with static flooding
- Unicast with static L2 (MAC) entries
- Unicast with static L3 entries
- Unicast with dynamic L3 entries
